### What I learned

I learned more about pseudo classes as I relied on it to target specific elements that have the same class or elements. For this project, I didn't try to use classes for some elements, that's why I had to rely on pseudo classes for it.


### Continued development

Cleaner, more efficient, and scalable codes in the future.
